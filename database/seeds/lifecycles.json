    "Welcome": "## Welcome to the ELSA Journal\n\n### A tool for embedding ethical, legal, and societal aspects in data science projects\n\nThe ELSA Journal is designed to support data scientists, offering practical guidance on questions, such as:\n\n- **Are we using data responsibly?**\n\n- **Have we considered the impact on individuals and communities?**\n\n- **What are the legal requirements or potential risks?**\n\n- **Who might be affected, and how are their interests being considered?**\n\nInstead of asking you to become an expert in ethics, law, or the social sciences, the platform offers practical guidance, curated tools, checklists, and methods tailored to each stage of the data science workflow.",
    "Introduction": "## The ELSA journal is like version control for your ethical reasoning.\n\nThe journal allows you to document your decisions and reflections in a structured, project-specific way—helping you keep track of how and when these considerations have been addressed.\n\nThe journal adds structure and traceability to a process that’s otherwise invisible — enabling smarter decisions, easier collaboration, and more robust, responsible systems. Just like a lab notebook in experimental science, an ELSA journal supports:\n\n- **Reproducibility:** Others (or your future self) can trace ethical and societal reasoning.\n\n- **Transparency:** Your rationale for handling fairness, privacy, or bias is documented, not buried in memory or Slack threads.",
    "Journal": "## Why keep an ELSA journal?\n\n**An ELSA journal helps to simplify compliance requirements and reviews:** making it easier to write final impact assessments, ethics summaries, or model documentation.\n\n**An ELSA journal encourages iterative reflection and course-correction:** capturing insights that can feed into model or data revisions down the line.\n\n**An ELSA journal can help to improve cross-disciplinary collaboration:** translating technical choices into accessible justifications for non-technical audiences.\n\n**An ELSA journal contributes to institutional learning and best practices:** becomes a living archive of lessons learned, revealing recurring ethical bottlenecks or high-risk points in the pipeline."
